React hook to handle forms

## Why another hook?

- After researching the form landscape we've found no library one could fully rely on: https://github.com/metamn/react-forms
- Libraries checked: `react-jsonschema-form`, `uniforms` Final Form, Formik, React Admin

## Approach

- Once we had lots of wishes: https://github.com/metamn/react-forms#goal
- Now we have less:

1. Form input handling made easy
2. Support for validations
3. Support for various design systems (Material UI, Bootstrap, etc...)

Surprisingly [React Hook Forms](https://github.com/metamn/react-hook-form-test) does all these ... out of the box.
